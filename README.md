# SPACE IMAGES

### Implementing features in an old school project, for learning purposes.

Some of the features are:
- The project was rewritten in React (originally vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Some smooth animations (loading spinner, page transitions, the logo) using Framer Motion and vanilla CSS
- Routing with React Router
- Like functionality (using local storage, which I might change to a DB at a later stage)
