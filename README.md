# SPACE IMAGES

### A place to discover space images

A small vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript was rewritten in React for learning purposes. Some other stuff has been added along the way:

- Some smooth animations (loading spinner, page transitions, the logo) using Framer Motion and vanilla CSS
- Routing with React Router
- Like functionality (using local storage)
