# SPACE IMAGES

### A place to discover space related images (and practise your coding skills)

Space Images is used as a learning project with focus on clean code and consistent structure. If you want to practise any of the techniques used in the project, this is a great place to do so.

Be sure to check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Short backstory of the project

A small vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript site was rewritten in React for learning purposes. Some other stuff has been added along the way:

- Some smooth animations (loading spinner, page transitions, the logo) using Framer Motion and vanilla CSS
- Routing with React Router
- Like functionality (using local storage)
