# SPACE IMAGES

Implementing features in an old school project, for learning purposes.

So far the focus has been to rewrite the project in React (originally written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Additionally, the following has been added:

- Some smooth animations (loading, page transitions, the logo) using Framer Motion and vanilla CSS
- Routing with React Router
- Like functionality (using local storage, which I might change to a DB at a later stage)

- [Deployed site on Vercel](https://space-images-app.vercel.app/)
- [The original repo](https://github.com/JoarHansson/space-images)
