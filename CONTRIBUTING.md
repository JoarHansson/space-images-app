## Proposing a Change

Feel free to submit an issue with or without a PR if you found a bug or if there is something you think should be improved.

## Issues

If you want to claim an existing issue you want to work on, you can do so. Simply submit a comment in the issue thread stating that you want to work on that issue. If somebody claims an issue but doesn't follow up for more than one week, it's fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.
