Space Images is used as a learning project with focus on clean code and consistent structure. If you want to practise any of the techniques used in the project, this is a great place to do so.

## Proposing a Change

Feel free to create an issue with or without a PR if you found a bug or if there is some feature you think should be added, or if there is something else you think could be improved. Anything is welcome.

## Issues

If you want to claim an existing issue you want to work on, you can do so. Simply submit a comment in the issue thread stating that you want to work on that issue. If somebody claims an issue but doesn't follow up for more than one week, it's fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.
